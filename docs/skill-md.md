# Writing SKILL.md

Your project's DNA. Everything an agent needs to understand *this* codebase.

---

## The Goal

Capture knowledge that would take hours to rediscover:

- Architecture decisions
- Domain rules that aren't obvious from code
- The weird parts where dragons live
- Environment and deployment quirks

An agent reading your SKILL.md should understand your project in 60 seconds.

---

## Structure

A good SKILL.md has these sections:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Frontmatter** | Name + description for agent discovery |
| **Project Overview** | One paragraph on what this is |
| **Architecture** | How the pieces connect |
| **Key Files** | Where to look for what |
| **Domain Rules** | Business logic not obvious from code |
| **The Weird Parts** | Known quirks, legacy code, footguns |
| **Environment** | Config, secrets, deployment |

---

## Frontmatter

Start with YAML frontmatter. This helps agents discover and identify skills:

```yaml
---
name: payment-api
description: Stripe integration for subscription billing
---
```

Some tools (like OpenCode) use this to list available skills. Keep it short.

---

## Project Overview

One paragraph. What is this thing?

> Payment API handles subscription billing via Stripe. It processes webhooks, manages customer lifecycle, and syncs subscription state to our database.
>
> Repository: `acme/payment-api`  
> Production: `payments.acme.com`

Don't oversell. Just state the facts.

---

## Architecture

Show how the pieces connect. ASCII diagrams work great:

```
settings.py             ← config, env vars
services/
├── stripe.py           ← Stripe API wrapper
├── billing.py          ← business logic
└── sync.py             ← DB ↔ Stripe sync
db/
├── models.py           ← SQLAlchemy models
└── queries.py          ← database access
api/
└── routes.py           ← FastAPI endpoints
```

Or use a simple flow:

```
Webhook → validate_signature → parse_event → update_database → notify_services
```

Keep it high-level. Details go in code.

---

## Key Files

A table of "where to find what":

| File | Purpose | Key Functions |
|------|---------|---------------|
| `services/billing.py` | Subscription logic | `create_subscription()`, `cancel()` |
| `services/stripe.py` | Stripe API wrapper | `StripeClient` class |
| `api/routes.py` | HTTP endpoints | `POST /webhook`, `GET /subscription` |
| `db/models.py` | Database schema | `Customer`, `Subscription` |

This saves agents from grepping blindly.

---

## Domain Rules

The business logic that *isn't* obvious from reading code:

**Pricing:**

- Prices stored in **cents**, displayed in **dollars**
- Never round during calculation, only on display

**Subscriptions:**

- Never delete subscriptions — mark as `cancelled`
- Grace period is 7 days after payment failure
- Downgrades take effect at period end

**Webhooks:**

- Signature verification is **mandatory**
- Process webhooks idempotently (same event may arrive twice)

These are the rules that would take a new developer hours to learn from code.

---

## The Weird Parts

Every codebase has dragons. Document them:

**`legacy_pricing.py`** — Uses the old Stripe API (pre-2020). Don't touch it. It handles grandfathered customers on the legacy plan. Will be removed when last legacy customer churns.

**`sync.py` timing** — Runs on a 5-minute cron, but Stripe webhooks arrive in ~1 second. There's a race condition if you rely on sync state immediately after a webhook.

**Test mode** — Tests hit Stripe test mode. You need `STRIPE_TEST_KEY` in `.env`. Requests are rate-limited to 25/sec even in test mode.

This section saves hours of debugging.

---

## Environment

What's needed to run this thing:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Stripe API key |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Webhook signature secret |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `REDIS_URL` | Cache connection string |

**Local Development:**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add your Stripe test keys
docker-compose up -d
uv run python -m api
```

**Deployment:**

- Push to `main` → deploys to staging
- Tag `v*` → deploys to production

---

## Length Guidelines

SKILL.md can be longer than AGENTS.md — it contains dense project knowledge. But still:

| Length | Status |
|--------|--------|
| < 100 lines | Probably missing important context |
| 100-300 lines | Sweet spot |
| > 300 lines | Consider splitting or trimming |

If it's getting long, ask: "Would an agent need this, or is it just documentation?"

---

## Full Example

Here's a complete SKILL.md in ~50 lines:

```yaml
---
name: payment-api
description: Stripe integration for subscription billing
---
```

```
# payment-api

Stripe-based subscription billing for Acme Corp.

Repository: acme/payment-api
Production: payments.acme.com

## Architecture

settings.py → services/ → db/ → api/

## Key Files

| File                   | Purpose             |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| services/billing.py    | Subscription logic  |
| api/routes.py          | HTTP endpoints      |

## Domain Rules

- Prices in cents, displayed in dollars
- Never delete subscriptions, cancel them
- Webhooks must be signature-verified

## The Weird Parts

- legacy_pricing.py — old Stripe API, don't touch
- Tests require STRIPE_TEST_KEY in env

## Environment

| Variable           | Description  |
|--------------------|--------------|
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY  | API key      |
| DATABASE_URL       | PostgreSQL   |
```

50 lines. Everything an agent needs.

## Next Steps

- Start with the [SKILL.template.md](https://github.com/Proteusiq/agentic/blob/main/SKILL.template.md)
- Fill in your project's specifics
- Add domain rules as you discover them
- Keep it updated — this is living documentation
